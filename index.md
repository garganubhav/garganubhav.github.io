Hi! I am a Research Engineer at Cisco Meraki, currently leading the research efforts in AI.
<br><br>
In AI, I am interested in distributed learning, meta-learning, unsupervised learning and NLP. At Cisco, I have worked on research prolems in AutoML and federated learning. I have published a prior project on budgeted NAS at NeurIPS Metalearning Workshop 2019 and another project, Katib-NAS at USENIX Conference on Operational
Machine Learning 2019. 

Prior to joining Cisco full-time, I participated in the Cisco International Internship Program at San Jose. Previously, I completed a dual degree program in M.Sc. Physics and B.E. Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan.
