Hi! I am an ML Engineer 2 at Cisco Meraki, currently leading the research and development efforts in AI. 
<br><br>
My goal is to develop highly innovative AI technology, specifically in the domain of computer vision and graphics. Before, I was a Research Engineer at Cisco, working on resource-efficient AutoML and federated learning in the computer vision setting, to make our devices more intelligent while taking into account issues of customers' data privacy.

Before joining Cisco full-time, I participated in the Cisco International Internship Program at San Jose. Prior to that, I spent 4 wonderful years at BITS Pilani, Rajasthan.
