Hi! I am a Research Engineer at Cisco, currently leading the research efforts in AI.
<br><br>
In AI, I am interested in distributed learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning and NLP. At Cisco, I have contributed in the areas of federated learning and AutoML. I have published a prior project on budgeted NAS at NeurIPSMetalearnWorkshop 2019 and another project, Katib-NAS at OpML2019.
