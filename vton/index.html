    <h1>Ongoing Research: Virtual Experiences Using Diffusion Models</h1>
    <h3>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>This ongoing research employs a diffusion model to create highly realistic and precise images. This technology aims to improve the online shopping experience by offering consumers a tailored and personalized approach.</p>
    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Small Business Owners:</strong> They can leverage this technology to create virtual catalogs without the need for physical inventory for photoshoots.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> They can better visualize how clothing items would look on them, leading to more informed purchasing decisions and reduced return rates. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Try the Tool:</h3>
    <p>Experience this cutting-edge virtual try-on technology firsthand! Demo the tool <a href="https://aaa31bbf045cf88e4b.gradio.live/">here</a>.</p>
    <h3> Further additions:</h3>
    <p> I am currently working on enhancing the existing model and integrating additional functionalities. Users will have the capability to upload images of their products and choose from a variety of pre-defined models for a more customized and interactive experience. Please check back for updates and thank you for your interest.</p>
